I would like to take a few minutes here to double-down on the problem that educators and students are currently facing.  This is an immediate societal challenge... it's not something we need to worry about happening in the future.  It's happening now.

The integration of AI into educational settings presents a multifaceted challenge for both students and educators. For students, the main issues include the temptation to misuse AI for completing assignments.  Yes, this could lead to potential academic dishonesty and whatever term we're going to land on for plagiarism of AI generated content, but more importantly this **will lead to our young people developing a poorly formed critical thinking and problem-solving skills**. We need to build awareness, tools and methodologies to help our young people navigate the landscape that is rapidly shifting under their feet.

Educators face the challenge of adapting their teaching methods and curricula to incorporate AI responsibly while ensuring it complements rather than replaces traditional learning methods. They must also develop strategies to detect and prevent AI misuse and provide guidance to students on ethical **and effective** AI usage. Moreover, educators need to keep pace with rapidly evolving AI technologies to remain effective in their teaching roles.

Both students and educators must navigate these challenges in a landscape where AI's capabilities and impact on education are rapidly expanding and transforming. We're setting out to do just that.
