The drama unfolding at OpenAI is more than just corporate politics – it's a stark warning to all of us. The control over AI and its societal benefits is in the hands of a few powerful and wealthy individuals. This saga at OpenAI is a microcosm of a much larger drama that will play out globally as AI becomes more powerful and valuable.

### The Drama at OpenAI: A Microcosm of Global AI Politics
In just the past week, we've seen cryptic messages and tumultuous events around Sam Altman's ouster from OpenAI. This has sparked a deluge of support for Sam and a wave of criticism towards the OpenAI board. Influential figures at OpenAI have resigned or hinted at resigning in protest. These events raise legitimate doubts about the future of OpenAI and its GPT technology amidst such turmoil.

### Microsoft's Heavy Hand in the AI Arena
Meanwhile, Microsoft, OpenAI's biggest investor, has been flexing its muscles very publicly. They may disagree with the board's decision, but they've made moves to hire Sam and his co-founder. This begs the question: What new opportunities or challenges could arise if Microsoft consolidates all this talent and energy?

### The Big Tech Conundrum: Corporate Interests vs. Societal Benefit
We have to ask ourselves – can we trust Big Tech companies, be it Microsoft, Amazon, IBM, Oracle, Facebook, or TikTok, to prioritize societal advancement over their own interests? OpenAI is on its way to becoming Big Tech, but during that journey there's an opportunity for them and others to revolutionize how technologies like GPT are used and distributed for the benefit of society at large.

### The Role of Community and Non-Big Tech Entities
Entrepreneurs, startups, scrappy developers, forward-thinking educators, and influencers – we all have a responsibility to ensure AI's power is used to pull society forward. We can't leave this immense responsibility solely to Big Tech.

The recent events at OpenAI, including Sam Altman's return, have made the future of AI slightly clearer, yet my optimism remains guarded. The impact of AI in the next 5-10 years could surpass that of social media or even the Internet. The coming months are crucial in shaping this future, and we all have a part to play in it.
